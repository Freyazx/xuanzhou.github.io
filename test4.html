I often go to see other people's notes and usage feelings, find other sharer's notes according to their skin texture and preferences, then look for them. It is very troublesome to buy products in various channels. Sometimes it is worried about the quality of the products. If there is such a platform that can be combined with the recommendation of other people in the community to share and purchase online, this will save time and effort. In addition, by scanning the QR code and setting the expiration reminder, the user can guarantee the quality and efficacy of the product. Therefore, I want to provide users with the most practical and comprehensive product reviews，information sharing and purchase channels through this platform, bringing convenience to all those who need it. Share and help each other to provide more effective product selection decisions and suggestions for more consumers who enjoy life.

The software uses machine learning to accurately and efficiently match massive information and people. We have collected as much product information and experience as possible, so that customers can easily find the use of friends of the same type of taste. Users are consumers, sharers, and peers.You can also create your own personal homepage, interact with interested friends, and comment on used products.Besides，Users can put the products they want to buy into the list of desires, and put the bought products into the “consumed list”, so that you don’t have to repeat the query every time you want to pay attention to and purchase the products, and take care of your product wish list. It has become a kind of enjoyment.Each user has a flexible and sensitive eye and a compassionate heart, and is always keen to explore popular new knowledge and collect popular information. For customers to release the latest activities and brand new product information newsletter.   And users can also use the software to scan the QR code to get the product features, ingredients and lifespan of the products you already have. Whether it is cosmetics, skin care products, or food, you can find information about this product. The user can set the product expiration reminder. When the expiration is about to expire, the system will automatically send a message to the user to remind the user that the product is about to expire. For example, girls' skin care products may have more than one skin care product. If the quantity is large, the consumer will ignore the expiration time and may not be aware of it sometimes. This time you need something to remind you that food is no exception. In this way, not only can the quality and efficacy of the product be guaranteed, but also the consumer will feel safe when using it.  Unlike other e-commerce platforms, this software is community-based and focuses on sharing shopping experiences in the community. Whether it's sports, beauty, food, travel, you can find information from the community to share with others. Every aspect of consumer experience and lifestyle. We also use big data and artificial intelligence to accurately match the content in the community to users interested in it, thereby enhancing the user experience, as well as accumulating overseas shopping data, analysing the most popular products and global shopping trends, and On this basis, the world's good things are delivered to users in the shortest path and in the most concise way.

At this time, the daily market maintenance team is needed to solve a series of problems. For example, some bugs hidden in the depths may only be discovered after the user experience, we can find defects, and improve and improve the software.
