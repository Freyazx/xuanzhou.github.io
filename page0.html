<h2 style="color:rgb(3, 40, 63)">Q1:What is your interest in IT? </h2>
<ul>
    <h4 style="color:rgb(3, 40, 63)">It is no doubt that parents always hope that we have a bright future. It is nothing but a high salary and a broad prospect for development. This kind of work is no more than the Internet industry. However, the pace of social life is relatively fast, and the speed of updating Internet information or technology is also very fast, especially In industries with relatively high technological content, I need to constantly learn to access new knowledge.By myself, actually I never get into IT field before, therefore I wanna explore the interesting things in IT. In additional, what interest me is that information technology is a new filed, and in this age of science.I believed that the technology will have a large enhancement and improvement in many aspects so I wanna develop and strengthen the skill of myself, to learn some updated information technology.

<h2 style="color:rgb(3, 40, 63)">Q2:When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h2>
<ul>
    <h4  style="color: rgb(3, 40, 63)">When I was young, the first phone I had was Nokia. It was a simple button phone with a black and white screen that only made calls and sent messages. When I am bored, I only can play small games. After a while I have a second mobile phone, iPhone 4, which is a smartphone that can touch the screen. I can download different software for my use, and at that time, I was curious about anything and I started to like the smartphone. Before that, we can only use the computer to search the web, view the video or shop online, but now it is just a mobile phone, you can do everything.Since then, I have had a keen interest in information technology, because every year there are many new styles of brands, and even more powerful electronic products appear in my sight. Until now, almost everyone can't leave the phone. Leaving the computer, to be precise, is unable to leave the network. All of this is the benefit that IT brings to people, giving people a convenient, fulfilling and happy life. So after entering the preparatory study, I applied for the IT major, because I would like to learn how to make a new and more interesting electronic product or electronic software when using technology products that were invented by others.My elder brother is a programmer, every time he edit the code to make a website or networking next to me, I always feel so cool and attract my attention.</h4>
