Before I graduate, all I have to do is to be familiar with and learn to use some programming languages, such as JavaScript, by on Rails. Or Go. At the same time, I am very willing to learn new programming languages, to improve HTML and JAVA, to allow more devices to support these programming languages, so that everyone can write programming at any time with the basic equipment. I need to have enough work experience and the ability to face problems in a timely manner, calm and efficient problem solving. Because if I want to be a leader, I need to have enough experience to help or solve the problems and situations that other members of the team will encounter, and pay more attention to details at work or in the project. Because as a leader, I need to have enough persuasiveness and even better talent. If the members of the team are equally good, I need to have better leadership and affinity. Otherwise, if a team is not harmonious, there is no way to do it. A better product or software can't meet the customer's requirements.

No matter what I am, in my usual life, I usually clean up my own things and don't like to see things indiscriminately. If I am a team leader in the future, I will also teach my team members to keep public items in the office. Entertainer personality types focus on the value and quality of the items around them, either not, or the best. Although these are qualities that make me proud and worth cherishing. But I am often not good at planning to complete things or trips or even post-work arrangements. At this point, I need to learn to plan my life, such as a trip or a date. In my work, I have to learn to plan my tasks, and I have to plan the tasks that the players should accomplish.
